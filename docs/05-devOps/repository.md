# Repository Management

To track the development of our project, we used a Github repository and created a dedicated organization called `ScaRLib-group`. The main repository is `ScaRLib`, which was divided into several branches: the `main` branch contains project releases, and the `develop` branch was used for ongoing development. For each necessary feature that needed to be added, a new branch was created from `develop` called `feature/feature-name`, and the same was done for bug fixes.
