# Future Work

Possible additional features that can be implemented in the future, in addition to those already present, thanks to the modularity of the system, may include the following:

- Add the ability to use neural networks of any type, not just feed-forward (e.g., CNN and/or RNN).
- Add more default learning algorithms (e.g., [MAPPO]).
- Consider integrating other tools for simulating the environment (e.g., [FlameGPU]).
