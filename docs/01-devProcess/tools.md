### GitHub
[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a hosting service for software development and version control management based on Git. It provides Git's distributed version control along with access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and a wiki for every project.

For our project, we used GitHub as a hosting service for the source code, GitHub actions to promote the continuous integration process, and GitHub Pages for documentation and explanation of the system implemented.

#### Semantic Release
[Semantic Release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/) is a service that automates the package release process for software projects.
