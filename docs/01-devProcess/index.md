# Development Process 

The adopted development process is an Agile approach, with integrations in the initial phase related to a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach.

Firstly, several knowledge crunching sessions were carried out, following a DDD approach. All team members and a domain expert participated in these meetings.

Once the domain was deeply explored in the initial phase, the architecture was designed, aiming to divide it into modules so that work division would be straightforward and integrations would result in fewer issues.

The system implementation was then divided into weekly sprints, and at the end of each sprint, a meeting was held with domain experts to validate the work done and ensure there were no discrepancies between expectations and achieved results.
