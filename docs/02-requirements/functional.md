# Functional Requirements:

The functional requirements relate to the functionalities that the system must make available to the user. To define them, it is necessary to rely on the user requirements extracted previously.


- Specify custom components, namely: state, reward function, environment and action space.
- Specify a custom neural network to approximate the Q-function.
- Add new learning algorithms in an agile way.
- Log information related to the training process.
- Take snapshots of policies to have a history of the training process.
- Visualize logged data in charts.
- Allow for visualization of agents in both training and testing phases using a GUI.
- Specify the learning system through a DSL.
- Express the computation of the environment state through aggregate programming.
