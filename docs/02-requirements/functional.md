# Functional Requirements:

The functional requirements relate to the functionalities that the system must make available to the user. To define them, it is necessary to rely on the user requirements extracted previously.


1. Specify custom components, namely: state, reward function, environment and action space.
2. Specify a custom neural network to approximate the Q-function.
3. Add new learning algorithms in an agile way.
4. Log information related to the training process.
5. Take snapshots of policies to have a history of the training process.
6. Visualize logged data in charts.
7. Allow for visualization of agents in both training and testing phases using a GUI.
8. Specify the learning system through a DSL.
9. Express the computation of the environment state through aggregate programming.
