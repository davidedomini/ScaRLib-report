# Non-functional Requirements:

Non-functional requirements concern the functionalities that the system does not necessarily have to possess in order to ensure that it is correct.

The following non-functional requirements have been identified within the system to be developed:

- It must be cross-platform, therefore it must be executable on any operating system capable of supporting Java version 17 or later.
- The interface used to display the graphs must be updatable at every moment of the training in order to monitor its progress in real time.
