# User Requirements:

The user requirements express the needs of the users and describe the actions that the user must be able to perform by interacting with the system.

From the previous domain analysis that was carried out, we can identify the following user requirements:

- Define your own components by implementing the abstractions offered by the framework.
- Monitor the learning progress by visualizing charts of selected metrics.
- Use the Alchemist GUI to visualize the execution of agents, both during training and testing.
