# Knowledge Crunching

After analyzing the client's request and the making the impact map, we had an interview with one of the clients, it is reported below.

<span style="color: #0077b6">**Analyst**</span>: 
    In the request you asked us to develop a tool for Cooperative Many Agent Reinforcement Learning, with the term "many" what order of magnitude do you mean ?

<span style="color: #79a355">**Domain expert**</span>: 
    I mean that the tool has to be able to handle from hundreds of agents to about one or two thousand.
