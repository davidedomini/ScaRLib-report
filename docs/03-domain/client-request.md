# Client Request

We are two members of a research group in the "Computer Science and Engineering" department at the University of Bologna. Currently, our research area is mainly Aggregate Computing, and more specifically, we are trying to use Reinforcement Learning techniques as a framework to engineer some complex systems.

To be more efficient in our research experiments, we need a tool that allows us to build Cooperative Many-Agent Reinforcement Learning systems in jvm-based environments efficiently and flexibly. So far, we have created ad-hoc solutions for each experiment that also leverage the Alchemist and Scafi tools, but these solutions are very rigid, difficult to change, and costly (in terms of time) to implement.

The general idea is, therefore, to have a Scala library that provides high-level abstractions for the CMARL domain and that integrates the Scafi and Alchemist tools in a flexible way.

## Impact Map

After the previously outlined request, the development team has decided to produce the following impact map in order to better understand the problem and formulate meaningful questions in subsequent interviews.
