## ScaRLib

[ScaRLib] is a Scala Framework for cooperative many agents reinforcement learning (CMARL). 

The aim of this project is to develop a tool that relies on state-of-the-art deep learning libraries to support the definition of CMARL systems in JVM-based environments. Moreover, ScaRLib integrates [Scafi] programming framework and [Alchemist] simulator to enable learning of field-based coordination policies for large-scale systems.
